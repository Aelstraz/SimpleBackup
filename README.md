### FEATURES:
- Intelligent file/folder checking to ensure subsequent backups don't transfer any files that are already located at the backup directory, as well as deleting any files from the backup directory that aren't found in your files/folders to backup
- Robust design to ensure that any errors don't stop the backup process, to ensure that what can get backed up still does
- MD5 checksum checking to ensure files don't get corrupted during transfer (can also be configured to run when comparing files before transfer)
- Schedule SimpleBackup to automatically run and backup at your desired times, without having to keep SimpleBackup open, or SimpleBackup having to run in the background (uses Windows Task Scheduler)
- Configurable to keep multiple backups at one time, in order to keep a backup history
- Ability to send an email to let you know when the backup is complete, and/or if any errors occured (all email settings are encrypted before being saved on your PC)
- A simple to use path filtering system- allowing you to back up only the files that you want to backup
- Backup to multiple destinations
- Numerous configurable features
- Automatically check for new updates
